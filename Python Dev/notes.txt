# boolean - true , false.
# sequential - string ,list, tuple


*operators
arithmetic relational assignment logical bitwise membership identity

membership operator to prepare

*control statment - control statment is controls the flow of the program
     two type of control statment
    1 conditional statment - it checks the condition and get executed when condition is true only
                             if we want to execute one or more condition when we want to use conditional statment
                             if, if else, elif ladder, nested if, for loop, while loop.
    2 loop statment -   it is a part of control statement logic repeated task again and again then we have to use loop statment
                        2-types of loop
                        for loop - used when no of iteration are known
                        while loop- used when no of iteration are not known but we know condition where to stop.

data type  two types
1 premitive :- imutable
2non premitive:-mutable

poy means many and morph means forms
it basiclay means that one thing but have many forms

4 ways in python to implement plymorphism
1 duck typing
    we can call any method on an object without checking its type as long as the method exist.

2 operator overloading
    giveing extended meaning beyond their pre-defined operational meaning
    e.g operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge 2 lists also

3 method overloading   '
    it is a compiled type polymorphism
    when class contains two or more methods with the same name but difffrent number of parameters
    then this scenario can be termed as method overloading.
    python does not support method overloading directly but we can implement it using different methods

4 method overriding
    it is a runtime polymorphism
    method define inside a subclass having a same name as a method in its super class but implement different functionality
    diffrent class name and same merhod name
